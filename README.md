# README.md Generator

## Description
This application takes user input and creates a README.md file. When the application begins, the user is promted for info and returns answers that will be sent into function. Those answers are then used to generate a readme. In order to generate the actual text on the readme in markdown, template literals are used. Once completed the user is returned a completely generated README.md file that is finished. This is either a complete readme or it can be used as a largely filled in skeleton readme.
